**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to send text messages to connected peers instantly
- As a user, I want to see when messages are delivered and read
- As a user, I want to see typing indicators when others are composing messages
- As a user, I want to view message history during the current session

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Messages appear in real-time (< 500ms latency)
- Message delivery status is clearly indicated
- Chat interface supports emoji and basic text formatting
- Message history persists during active session

### FR2: Peer Discovery & Connection
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Users can discover and connect to other peers on the same network or through room codes.

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to join a chat room using a simple room code
- As a user, I want to see who is currently online in my room
- As a user, I want to be notified when peers join or leave
- As a user, I want automatic reconnection if my connection drops

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Room joining works with 6-character alphanumeric codes
- Peer list updates in real-time
- Connection status is clearly displayed
- Automatic reconnection attempts up to 3 times

### FR3: Direct File Transfer
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Users can share files directly with connected peers without server storage.

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to drag and drop files to share them
- As a user, I want to see transfer progress for large files
- As a user, I want to accept or decline incoming file transfers
- As a user, I want to transfer multiple files simultaneously

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Supports files up to 1GB in size
- Transfer progress shown with percentage and speed
- File preview for images before transfer
- Batch file selection and transfer

### FR4: User Interface
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Clean, intuitive interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want a simple, clean chat interface
- As a user, I want responsive design that works on mobile
- As a user, I want dark/light theme options
- As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts for common actions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Mobile-responsive design (works on screens 320px+)
- Theme switching without page reload
- Common shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to send, etc.)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **Message Latency**: < 500ms for text messages
- **File Transfer Speed**: Utilize full available bandwidth
- **Connection Time**: < 5 seconds to establish P2P connection
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB RAM for typical usage

### NFR2: Scalability
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 2-10 users per room initially
- **File Size Limits**: Up to 1GB per file transfer
- **Room Capacity**: 50 active rooms on signaling server
- **Growth Path**: Architecture supports scaling to SFU/MCU

### NFR3: Reliability
- **Uptime**: 99.5% availability for signaling server
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection within 30 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on connection issues
- **Data Integrity**: File transfer with checksum verification

### NFR4: Security & Privacy
- **Data Transmission**: All P2P data bypasses servers
- **Connection Security**: WebRTC DTLS encryption
- **Privacy**: No message storage on servers
- **Authentication**: Room-based access control

### NFR5: Cost Efficiency
- **Server Costs**: < $10/month for up to 1000 active users
- **Bandwidth**: Zero server bandwidth for P2P data
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal signaling server requirements
- **Scaling**: Linear cost growth with user base

## Technical Constraints

### TC1: Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 14+, Edge 80+
- **WebRTC Support**: Required for P2P functionality
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 80+

### TC2: Network Requirements
- **NAT Traversal**: STUN server support required

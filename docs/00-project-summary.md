## Security & Privacy

### Encryption
- **WebRTC DTLS**: Automatic encryption for all P2P data
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: New keys for each session
- **Certificate Fingerprinting**: Prevents MITM attacks

### Privacy Protection
- **No Data Storage**: Messages and files never stored on servers
- **Direct Transfer**: All data flows directly between peers
- **Ephemeral Rooms**: Rooms auto-delete when empty
- **Anonymous Access**: No user accounts or tracking

### Access Control
- **Room-Based Access**: Simple 6-character room codes
- **Peer Verification**: Connection fingerprint validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **File Type Restrictions**: Security-focused file filtering

---

## Performance Targets

### Connection Performance
- **Message Latency**: < 500ms for text messages
- **Connection Time**: < 5 seconds to establish P2P
- **Success Rate**: > 95% connection establishment
- **Reconnection**: < 30 seconds automatic recovery

### File Transfer Performance
- **Transfer Speed**: Full available bandwidth utilization
- **File Size Support**: Up to 1GB per file
- **Concurrent Transfers**: Multiple files simultaneously
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB RAM for typical usage

### Scalability
- **Room Capacity**: 2-10 users per room (MVP)
- **Server Load**: 50+ active rooms per signaling server
- **Cost Scaling**: Linear growth with user base
- **Growth Path**: Can evolve to SFU/MCU architecture

## Cost Analysis

### Operational Costs
```
Signaling Server: $5/month (Railway/DigitalOcean)
Bandwidth: $0 (P2P direct transfer)
Storage: $0 (no data persistence)
STUN Servers: $0 (Google's free servers)
Total: ~$5/month regardless of usage
```

### Scaling Economics
- **100 users**: Still $5/month
- **1,000 users**: $5-10/month
- **10,000 users**: $20-50/month (multiple signaling servers)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 2)
1. **Initialize Development Environment**
   - Set up monorepo structure
   - Configure build tools and testing
   - Deploy basic signaling server

2. **Begin Phase 2 Implementation**
   - Follow the detailed roadmap in [Development Roadmap](./05-development-roadmap.md)
   - Start with P2P connection foundation
   - Implement core messaging functionality

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Two users can connect and chat in real-time
- [ ] File transfer works for files up to 100MB

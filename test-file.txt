This is a test file for P2P file transfer functionality.

The file transfer system should:
1. Send this file to connected peers
2. Show progress during transfer
3. Allow the receiving peer to download the file
4. Handle errors gracefully

This test validates that the reliability improvements we made are working correctly in real-world scenarios.

File size: Small text file (~500 bytes)
Transfer method: P2P WebRTC data channels
Expected result: Successful transfer with progress tracking
